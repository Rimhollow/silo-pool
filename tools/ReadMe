Some of these tools are for migrating our old silo data:

 * silo-on-disk-fixity
   
   Walks an on-disk silo and performs checksums on all of the packages
   it finds there, entering new historical fixitiy records - md5, sha1
   checksums - with implicit time.  The checksums are added to the
   histories and packages tables in the database.

 * silo-on-tape-fixity

   First checks to see if there is a silo marked as 'disk-idling', and
   checks that the tivoli listing is consistent with what's currently
   on disk; then does fixity check - if all pass, mark as
   'tape-master'.  If there are no 'disk-idling' silos, selects the
   silo that has the oldest complete fixity check; it is extracted
   from tivoli and written to a scratch disk.

 * favicon/  
 
   Favicon hacks; we are actually using one produced by Tenille.
