Some of these utlities are specific to the Florida Digital Archive,
but are included as a starting point for your own DAITSS development.
Of general applicablity:

 * disk-fixity
   
   Walks an on-disk silo and performs checksums on all of the packages
   it finds there, entering new historical fixitiy records - md5, sha1
   checksums - with implicit time.  The checksums are added to the
   histories and packages tables in the database. Meant to be used from cron.

 * create-db

   Initialize the silo pool databases.  Run this without arguments for directions:

   bundle exec ./create-db

 * admin-password

   Clear or set the admin password for the site, which uses basic web authentication
   against a user 'admin' - Run this without arguments for directions:

   bundle exec ./create-db

  * md5-base64

    Given a filename on the commandline, print the MD5 hash in base 64
    notation.  Useful backquoted in testing scripts using curl, e.g.

    curl -sv -X PUT -H "Content-MD5: `md5-base64 filename`" --upload-file filename http://silos.com/001/data/E19561201_ABCXYZ

    Shouldn't require bundler to use it.
 
FDA specific, no warranties expressed or implied:

 * tape-fixity

   First checks to see if there is a silo marked as 'disk-idling', and
   checks that the tivoli listing is consistent with what's currently
   on disk; then does fixity check - if all pass, mark as
   'tape-master'.  If there are no 'disk-idling' silos, selects the
   silo that has the oldest complete fixity check; it is extracted
   from tivoli and written to a scratch disk.

 * tivolis-ls

   Give it a silo, e.g. /daitssfs/001, and it will list it out - but
   only for the files you owned when the last backup was made.  Uses
   options appropriate to our archive/backup strategy.

 * tivolis-fetch
  
   Needs to be fleshed out, as the above. Meant to fetch a sub-directory
   of a tape-based silo.
   
  * put-to-silo

    hacky test script that puts data to a silo-pool using an old protocol

  * favicon/  
 
   Favicon hacks; we are actually using one produced by Tenille.
