# This is an example of the DAITSS configuration file restricted to
# the data necessary to run the silo-pool service.
#
# You must set up your web server to set the environment variable
# DAITSS_CONFIG to point to a configuration file along these lines,
# though typically it will have sections for many services in addition
# to this one.
#
# Please don't use tabs in this file.

defaults:
     temp_directory:             /var/tmp
     fixity_expired_days:	 60
     fixity_stale_days:          45

database:
     silo_db:                    postgres://silos:topsecret@localhost/my_silo_db

# We normally name sections after the virtual hostname used by an
# web server (this is so one physical host can run multiple services
# of the same kind).  An application's configuration code typically
# checks the VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME environment variable to determine the
# appropriate section to load.  Usually VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME is set in
# the same place that the DAITSS_CONFIG environment is set.

# defaults:temp_directory
# -----------------------
# Where should temporary files be created? This should be at least
# twice the size of the largest package you plan to ingest, plus
# headroom.  Defaults to system-defined temp directory (typically
# /tmp/)
#
# default:fixity_expired_days
# ---------------------------
# The number of days after which fixity check data will
# be reported as out-of-date.  Defaults to 60 days. Used
# by some of the fixity scripts
#
# default:fixity_stale_days
# -------------------------
# The number of days after which fixity check data will
# be recalulated. Defaults to 45 days. Used by some of the
# fixty scripts



# database
# ========
# There are three postgres databases used by DAITSS, this file
# shows
#
# database:silo_db
# -----------------------
# Required, the database connection string for the silo-pool database.
# Supported vendors: postgres. Some fields are optional - for
# instance, if there is no password and you use the postgres default
# port, 5432:
#
#   postgres://username@hostname/database
#
# With port and password it looks like
#
#   vendor://username:password@hostname:port/database
#
# N.B.  This means that this config file should have read permissions
# retricted to the user running the service, or an appropriately
# restricted group.


# silo-pools.example.org
# ======================
#
# This section sets the variables specific to the silo-pool web
# service.
#
# silo:log_database_queries
# -------------------------
# Should we log database queries? defaults to false.  These can
# generate very large logs, so it's only recommended for
# troubleshooting and learning.
#
# silo:log_filename
# -----------------
# If set, direct log information to this file. If neither log_filename
# nor log_syslog_facility are set, log to STDERR.  log_filename should
# be unique to this service.  If you want to share output from
# multiple services to one file, use syslog.
#
# silo:log_syslog_facility
# ------------------------
# If set, direct log information to this syslog facility (see
# /etc/syslog.conf). If neither log_filename nor log_syslog_facility
# are set, log to STDERR.
#
# silo:required_pools
# -------------------
# How many pool servers are we required to connect to?  Defaults to
# 2. Use zero for a 'stub server' for testing - in that case, nothing
# will actually be stored.
#
# silo:silo_temp_directory
# ------------------------
# A temporary directory for caching data from Tivoli
# data storage - only used with the FDA style of tape
# storage. Defaults to /tmp/
#
# silo:tivoli_server
# ------------------
# The name of the Tivolo tape server, if you are using
# DAITSS with the FDA style of tape storage. No defaults.


# disk-fixity
# ===========
#
# This section sets specific variables for the disk-fixity script.
# disk-fixity also uses database settings and the default fixity_stale_days
# and fixity_expired_days variables (several scripts use these latter).
#
# disk-fixity:fresh_enough
# ------------------------
# The number of days before which we will not repeat a fixity check.
# Defaults to zero (will always perform a fixity check).
#
# disk-fixity:hostname
# --------------------
# The hostname we're checking: packages in the silo database
# are associated with a particular hostname.
#
# disk-fixity:log_syslog_facility
# -------------------------------
# If set, direct log information to this syslog facility (see
# /etc/syslog.conf). If neither log_filename nor log_syslog_facility
# are set, log to STDERR.
#
# disk-fixity:log_filename
# ------------------------
# If set, direct log information to this file. If neither log_filename
# nor log_syslog_facility are set, log to STDERR.  log_filename should
# be unique to this service.  If you want to share output from
# multiple services to one file, use syslog.
#
# disk-fixity:log_database_queries
# --------------------------------
# If set, log database queries. Can generate very large logs and
# degrade performance.
#
# disk-fixity:pid_directory
# -------------------------
# If pid_directory is set, use it to write a lock file so that
# there cannot be multiple copies of the script running. If
# not present no locking will be done
