TO DO  - some of these scripts  are a little outdated and need
to be modified to work in a bundler environment. (see silo-on-disk-fixity)


Some of these tools are for migrating our old silo data:

 * create-sha1-and-update-types
   writes sha1 metadata and type files to all the packages hashpaths in the specified silo.
   this is to update incomplete information before things are migrated to tape.

 * silo-prime-db (deprecated?)
   walks a silo filesystem, entering the packages into the new silo database - creates an entry
   for the silo, the package entry, and places a PUT event into the histories database.

 * silo-on-disk-fixity
   walks an on-disk silo and performs checksums on all of the packages it finds there, entering
   new historical fixitiy records - md5, sha1 - with implicit time.  The checksums are added to
   the histories and packages tables in the database. 

 * misc-sql
   for snippets of useful SQL - only one now

 * ddl.mysql.transitional - current db schema

 * ddl.mysql  - proposed new db schema - breaks out forbidden flag into separate booleans.
 
 * ddl.psql  - proposed new db schema, postgres


 * favicon/  -  favicon hacks - needs lots of work.
