Randy,

The management classes in the test tape environment were "LOCAL1",
"LOCAL2", and "REMOTE".  REMOTE of course no longer works since
we are long off of NWRDC's Tivoli server.

The key to accessing the test environment instead of the production
one was to use the option

 Servername=ADSM_TEST

whenever writing to or reading from the tapes.

The associated tape pools with those management classes still are

 "darchive1test3" for LOCAL1

 "darchive2test3" for LOCAL2

Let me know if you need any more info.

Darryl
