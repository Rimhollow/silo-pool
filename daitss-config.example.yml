# This is an example of the DAITSS configuration file restricted to
# the data necessary to run the silo-pool service.
#
# You must set up your web server to set the environment variable
# DAITSS_CONFIG to point to a configuration file along these lines,
# though typically it will have sections for many services in addition
# to this one.
#
# Please don't use tabs in this file.

defaults:
     temp_directory:             /var/tmp

database:
     silo_db:                    postgres://silos:topsecret@localhost/my_silo_db

# We normally name sections after the virtual hostname used by an
# applcation (this is so one physical host can run multiple services
# of the same kind).  An application's configuration code typically
# checks the VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME environment variable to determine the
# appropriate section to load.  Typically VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME is set in
# the same place that the DAITTS_CONFIG environment is set.

silo-pool.example.org:
     log_database_queries:       false
     log_syslog_facility:        LOG_LOCAL0
     log_filename:               /path/to/name/of/file.log

# defaults:temp_directory
# -----------------------
# Where should temporary files be created? This should be at least
# twice the size of the largest package you plan to ingest, plus
# headroom.  Defaults to system-defined temp directory (typically
# /tmp/)
#
# database:silo_db
# -----------------------
# Required, the database connection string for the silo-pool database.
# Supported vendors: postgres. Some fields are optional - for
# instance, if there is no password and you use the postgres default
# port, 5432:
#
#   postgres://username@hostname/database
#
# With port and password it looks like
#
#   vendor://username:password@hostname:port/database
#
# N.B.  This means that this config file should have read permissions
# retricted to the user running the service, or an appropriately
# restricted group.
#
# silo:log_database_queries
# -------------------------
# Should we log database queries? defaults to false.  These generate
# very large logs, so it's only recommended for troubleshooting and
# learning.
#
# silo:log_syslog_facility
# -------------------------------
# If set, direct log information to this syslog facility (see
# /etc/syslog.conf). If neither log_filename nor log_syslog_facility
# are set, log to STDERR.
#
# silo:log_filename
# -------------------------------
# If set, direct log information to this file. If neither log_filename
# nor log_syslog_facility are set, log to STDERR.
#
# silo:required_pools
# -------------------
# How many pool servers are we required to connect to?  Defaults to
# 2. Use zero for a 'stub server' for testing - in that case, nothing
# will actually be stored.
#
# silo_temp_directory
# -------------------
# A temporary directory for caching data from Tivoli
# data storage - only used with the FDA style of tape
# storage. Defaults to /tmp/
#
# tivoli_server
# -------------
# The name of the Tivolo tape server, if you are using
# DAITSS with the FDA style of tape storage. No defaults.
#
# fixity_expired_days
# -------------------
# The number of days after which fixity check data will
# be reported as out-of-date.  Defaults to 60 days.
#
# fixity_stale_days
# -----------------
# The number of days after which fixity check data will
# be recalulated. Defaults to 45 days.
